# All Weather v2.0 - Daily Mean-Reversion Design

**Date**: 2026-02-26
**Status**: Approved

## Overview

Add daily mean-reversion logic to the All Weather strategy. When individual assets drift beyond a threshold from their target weights, immediately trim (if up) or buy (if down) back to target.

## Motivation

v1.2 only checks drift weekly on rebalance days. This misses opportunities to:
- Lock in gains when an asset rallies quickly mid-week
- Buy dips when an asset drops significantly before Monday

## Core Logic

```
DAILY (every trading day):
  For each asset:
    drift = current_weight - target_weight
    if |drift| > drift_threshold:
      if drift > 0: SELL asset back to target weight (lock in gains)
      if drift < 0: BUY asset back to target weight (buy the dip)

WEEKLY (Monday):
  Recalculate target_weights via risk parity optimization (Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Tuning Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| `drift_threshold` | 5% | 3%, 5%, 7%, 10%, 15% | Trigger threshold for buy/sell |
| `lookback` | 252 days | - | Covariance lookback (unchanged) |
| `commission_rate` | 0.03% | - | Transaction cost (unchanged) |
| `use_shrinkage` | True | - | Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage (unchanged) |

## Version Comparison

| Feature | v1.2 | v2.0 |
|---------|------|------|
| Check frequency | Weekly | **Daily** |
| Drift threshold | 5% symmetric | Tunable (default 5%) |
| Action | Full portfolio rebalance | **Targeted per-asset buy/sell** |
| Target weight update | Weekly | Weekly (unchanged) |
| Shrinkage | Yes | Yes (unchanged) |

## Implementation

### New Class: `AllWeatherV2`

Extends v1.2 with:
- Daily drift checking in backtest loop
- Per-asset trim/buy logic (not full rebalance)
- Tracking of intraweek trades

### Key Methods

```python
def check_daily_drift(self, current_prices: pd.Series) -> List[Trade]:
    """Check each asset for drift beyond threshold, return trades needed."""

def execute_trim(self, asset: str, target_weight: float, current_prices: pd.Series):
    """Sell asset back to target weight."""

def execute_buy(self, asset: str, target_weight: float, current_prices: pd.Series):
    """Buy asset back to target weight using available cash or selling others."""
```

### Backtest Loop Changes

```python
for date in backtest_period:
    # DAILY: Check drift and execute trim/buy if needed
    daily_trades = self.check_daily_drift(current_prices)
    if daily_trades:
        self.execute_trades(daily_trades)

    # WEEKLY (Monday): Update target weights
    if is_rebalance_day(date):
        self.update_target_weights(hist_returns)
```

## Validation Plan

Same train/validate/test split as existing `tune_threshold.py`:

| Phase | Period | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Train | 2018-2023 | Find best drift_threshold |
| Validate | 2024 | Confirm generalization (must be top-3) |
| Test | 2025-2026 | Final out-of-sample check |

**Primary metric**: Sharpe ratio
**Secondary metrics**: Max drawdown, annual return, turnover, trade count

### Tuning Script

Create `scripts/tune_v2_threshold.py`:
- Test thresholds: [3%, 5%, 7%, 10%, 15%]
- Compare v2.0 vs v1.2 baseline
- Output recommendation with confidence

## Expected Outcomes

**Potential benefits:**
- Better capture of mean-reversion premium
- Reduced drawdowns (faster reaction to dips)
- More profit-taking (lock gains before reversal)

**Potential risks:**
- Higher turnover → more commissions
- Whipsawing in volatile periods
- May underperform in trending markets

## Success Criteria

v2.0 is successful if:
1. Best threshold achieves higher Sharpe than v1.2 on training data
2. Best threshold ranks top-3 on validation data
3. Test Sharpe ≥ v1.2 test Sharpe
