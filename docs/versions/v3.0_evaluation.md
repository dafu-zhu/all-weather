# All Weather v3.0 - Primary Improvements Evaluation

## Executive Summary

**Result**: All primary Bridgewater-inspired improvements **FAILED** to improve performance.
**Recommendation**: Keep v2.0 as production strategy. Document learnings and avoid these approaches.

## Baseline Performance (v2.0)

- **Annual Return**: 12.23%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 0.75
- **Max Drawdown**: -16.02%
- **Period**: 2018-2026

## Primary Improvements Tested

### 1. Economic Environment Framework
**Goal**: Balance risk across 4 economic quadrants (Growth+/-, Inflation+/-)
**Implementation**: Map assets to environments, add penalty term for unbalanced contributions
**Result**: **NO EFFECT** - Produces identical weights to v2.0
**Root Cause**: With only 7 ETFs, we don't have enough assets in each environment to create meaningful balance. The asset-type constraints (60% stocks, 35% bonds) already determine allocation.

### 2. Volatility Targeting
**Goal**: Scale positions to maintain 10% target volatility
**Implementation**: Calculate realized 60-day vol, scale weights accordingly
**Result**: **NO EFFECT** (identical to no vol targeting)
**Root Cause**: Normalization to sum=1.0 eliminates the scaling effect. The vol targeting becomes equivalent to maintaining the same proportional weights.

### 3. Return-Aware Optimization
**Goal**: Optimize Sharpe ratio instead of pure risk parity
**Implementation**: Combined objective = (1-λ)*std(risk_contrib) + λ*(-Sharpe), using EWMA returns
**Result**: **-1.3pp return, -0.15 Sharpe** (significantly worse)
**Root Cause**:
- EWMA returns (60-day span) are too short-term and noisy
- Optimizer chases recent performance, creating concentrated portfolios
- Example: During COVID (2020-03), allocated 47% S&P + 40% Gold, 0% bonds
- This violates All Weather philosophy of permanent diversification

### 4. Depression Gauge & Safe Portfolio
**Goal**: Detect crises and switch to 70% bonds / 30% gold
**Implementation**: 3 signals (vol spike, drawdown, momentum), trigger on 2/3
**Result**: **-3.9pp return, -0.30 Sharpe** (catastrophic)
**Root Cause**:
- Triggered 6 times during 2018-2026 (too frequent)
- Each trigger switched to 70% bonds / 30% gold (missed equity rallies)
- False positives: 2019-02, 2022-03, 2022-06, 2024-03, 2024-11
- Even during real crisis (COVID 2020-04), exited too early (2020-06)

## Variant Testing Results

| Variant | Annual Return | Sharpe | vs v2.0 |
|---------|---------------|--------|---------|
| v2.0 Baseline | 12.23% | 0.75 | — |
| v3.0 Full | 8.34% | 0.45 | -3.89pp ❌ |
| v3.0 No Crisis | 10.87% | 0.59 | -1.36pp ❌ |
| v3.0 Only Return Opt | 10.96% | 0.59 | -1.27pp ❌ |
| v3.0 Only Environment | 12.23% | 0.75 | 0.00pp (no effect) |

**Conclusion**: Every single improvement either has no effect or harms performance.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Environment Balancing Failed
- **Insufficient Assets**: Only 7 ETFs spread across 3-4 environments
- **Constraint Dominance**: 60% stock / 35% bond constraints already determine allocation
- **No Degrees of Freedom**: Not enough flexibility to balance environments while meeting constraints

### Why Return Optimization Failed
- **Data Mining**: EWMA(60) returns chase recent performance
- **Concentrated Portfolios**: Optimizer finds "optimal" concentration that fails out-of-sample
- **Philosophy Violation**: All Weather should be diversified always, not tactically tilted
- **Sample Period Bias**: 2018-2026 favored US tech (S&P, Nasdaq), but EWMA chased this trend

### Why Depression Gauge Failed
- **High False Positive Rate**: 4 out of 6 crisis signals were false alarms
- **Opportunity Cost**: Switching to 70% bonds missed equity rallies (2019, 2022, 2024-25)
- **Exit Timing**: Even real crisis (COVID) exited too early (June 2020, before full recovery)
- **Safe Portfolio Underperformance**: 70% bonds + 30% gold severely underperforms during normal markets

## Lessons Learned

### ❌ What NOT to Do

1. **Don't optimize on short-term returns** - EWMA(60) is too noisy for strategic allocation
2. **Don't overcomplicate constraints** - 7 ETFs can't meaningfully balance 4 environments
3. **Don't chase recent performance** - Return optimization led to concentrated portfolios
4. **Don't use crisis detection for tactical allocation** - High false positive rate destroys returns
5. **Don't abandon diversification** - All Weather = permanent diversification, not tactical tilts

### ✅ What Works

1. **Simple constrained risk parity** (v2.0) outperforms complex optimizations
2. **Asset-type constraints** (60% stocks, 35% bonds) are sufficient and effective
3. **Monthly rebalancing** balances costs and responsiveness
4. **100-day covariance lookback** provides stable estimates without overfitting

## Recommendation

### Production Strategy
**Use v2.0 as-is. Do not implement v3.0.**

v2.0 Configuration:
- Monthly rebalancing
- 100-day covariance lookback
- 60% minimum stocks, 35% maximum bonds
- Constrained risk parity optimization
- **No return forecasting, no crisis detection, no tactical tilts**

### Future Improvements to Consider

**If we revisit improvements (Phase 2), focus on:**

1. **Simpler approaches only**:
   - Config-driven asset classification (cleanup)
   - Threshold-based rebalancing (reduce costs)
   - Longer lookback periods for stable covariance

2. **Avoid at all costs**:
   - Return optimization with short horizons
   - Crisis detection / tactical allocation
   - Environment balancing with <10 assets

## Phase 2 Decision

**Should we proceed to Phase 2 fallback improvements?**

**NO.** Here's why:

1. **Phase 2 won't fix fundamental issues** - The problem isn't missing features, it's that Bridgewater techniques don't transfer to 7-ETF retail strategy
2. **v2.0 already excellent** - 12.23% return, 0.75 Sharpe, 3x benchmark
3. **Complexity adds risk** - More code = more ways to fail, harder to maintain
4. **Opportunity cost** - Time better spent on other projects

## Final Verdict

✅ **v2.0 is production-ready and optimal for this use case**
❌ **v3.0 improvements are all net-negative**
📊 **Success = Validated that simpler is better**

This is a successful outcome: we tested improvements rigorously and discovered they don't help. This prevents degrading a working strategy with unnecessary complexity.
