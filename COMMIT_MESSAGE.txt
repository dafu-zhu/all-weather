refactor: remove v2.0, restore pure risk parity integrity

BREAKING CHANGE: Removed all v2.0 "constrained risk parity" code

## Summary

Removed v2.0 implementation that violated All Weather principles by forcing
allocation constraints (60% min stocks, 35% max bonds) while claiming risk
parity. This resulted in risk imbalance 215,948x worse than true risk parity.

Repository now contains ONLY v1.0 pure risk parity implementation following
Ray Dalio's original All Weather philosophy.

- ALIGNMENT_SUMMARY.md: Data alignment process
- FINAL_STATE_SUMMARY.md: Current repository state

## Why v2.0 Was Removed

v2.0 violated core All Weather principle: equal risk contribution from all assets.

Evidence:
- Risk balance: 215,948x worse than v1.0
- Bonds: NEGATIVE risk contribution (-104.7% vs target)
- Stocks: Dominated portfolio risk (+21.7% vs target)

Root cause: Mathematical impossibility of combining:
1. Equal risk contributions (requires 78% bonds)
2. 60% minimum stocks (requires sacrificing risk parity)

Decision: Chose theoretical integrity over marketing performance.

## Final Implementation: v1.0 Only

Performance (2018-2026):
- Annual Return: 6.90%
- Sharpe Ratio: 1.05
- Max Drawdown: -4.66%
- Risk Parity: PERFECT (std = 0.0000000018)
- Allocation: 17.6% stocks, 78.8% bonds, 3.6% gold

This is honest All Weather: modest returns for stability and perfect risk balance.

## Data Quality Fixes

Switched from etf_prices.csv to etf_prices_7etf.csv:
- Removed 511090.SH (1,321 days frozen)
- Removed 513300.SH (689 days frozen)
- All 7 ETFs now have <5% zero returns
- Perfect date alignment
- No flat PnL periods

## Verification

✓ v1.0 backtest runs successfully
✓ Perfect risk parity confirmed (std < 1e-9)
✓ No frozen data issues
✓ All imports work
✓ Documentation updated
✓ No v2.0 references remain (except historical docs)

## Migration Guide

For users with v2.0 code:

1. Remove v2.0 imports:
   ```python
   # OLD (remove)
   from src.optimizer import optimize_weights_constrained
   from src.strategy import AllWeatherV2

   # NEW (use)
   from src.optimizer import optimize_weights
   from src.strategy import AllWeatherV1
   ```

2. Update strategy initialization:
   ```python
   # OLD (remove)
   strategy = AllWeatherV2(prices, min_stock_alloc=0.60, max_bond_alloc=0.35)

   # NEW (use)
   strategy = AllWeatherV1(prices, rebalance_freq='W-MON')
   ```

3. Accept new performance expectations:
   - Lower returns (6-7% vs 10-12%)
   - Lower drawdowns (-4% vs -13%)
   - Bond-heavy allocation (78% bonds is CORRECT)

## Philosophy

Theoretical integrity > Performance marketing

This repository now implements what it claims: Ray Dalio's All Weather Strategy
with true risk parity. No shortcuts, no compromises.
