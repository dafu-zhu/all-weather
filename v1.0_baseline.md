# All Weather Strategy - v1.0 Baseline Results

**Strategy**: Risk Parity Portfolio Implementation
**Date**: 2026-01-28
**Backtest Period**: 2018-01-02 to 2026-01-28 (8 years)

---

## Executive Summary

Implemented Ray Dalio's All Weather Strategy for A-share market using risk parity optimization. The strategy achieved **3.71% annual return** with **2.42% volatility** and **-4.12% max drawdown** over 8 years, significantly underperforming the PDF targets but demonstrating excellent risk control.

**Key Findings**:
- ❌ Annual return **far below** PDF target (3.71% vs 20-25%)
- ✅ Volatility **excellent** (2.42% vs ~5% target)
- ✅ Max drawdown **excellent** (-4.12% vs 6-10% target)
- ❌ Sharpe ratio **far below** target (0.30 vs 3.0-4.0)

**Conclusion**: Strategy successfully achieves low volatility and minimal drawdown but fails to generate adequate returns. Phase 2 improvements are **REQUIRED**.

|-------------|----------|------|--------------|
| Stock | 510300.SH | 沪深300 | 5-7% |
| Stock | 510500.SH | 中证500 | 3-5% |
| Stock | 513500.SH | 标普500 | 5-6% |
| Stock | 513300.SH | 纳指 | 4-5% |

*Note: 510170.SH (大宗商品) was excluded - only 7 ETFs used in backtest*

### Rebalancing Strategy

- **Frequency**: Weekly (every Monday)
- **Lookback Period**: 100 trading days for covariance calculation
- **Transaction Cost**: 0.03% per trade (each way)
- **Position Sizing**: Risk parity - each asset contributes equally to portfolio risk

### Risk Parity Optimization

Weights are calculated to minimize the standard deviation of risk contributions:

```
minimize: std(risk_contributions)
subject to:
  - sum(weights) = 1.0
  - 0 ≤ weight_i ≤ 1.0 for all i
```

Risk contribution for asset i: `RC_i = weight_i × (∂σ_p/∂weight_i)`

## Analysis

### What Worked Well

1. **Volatility Control**: 2.42% annual volatility is exceptionally low, even better than the 5% target
2. **Drawdown Protection**: -4.12% max drawdown is excellent, significantly better than the 6-10% target
3. **Risk Parity**: Risk contributions were successfully equalized across assets
4. **Benchmark Comparison**: Dramatically lower volatility (2.42% vs 21.98%) and drawdown (-4.12% vs -44.75%)

### Critical Issues

1. **Insufficient Returns**: 3.71% annual return is far below the 20-25% target
   - Only 0.31% above benchmark despite 90% lower volatility
   - Barely beats inflation

2. **Poor Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Sharpe ratio 0.30 vs target 3.0-4.0
   - Risk parity optimization prioritized stability over returns

3. **Low Win Rate**: 27.26% suggests strategy is right only 1/4 of the time
   - However, this is somewhat expected for a low-volatility strategy

4. **Bond Dominance**: 10-year bond ETF comprises 60-65% of portfolio
   - Bonds had low returns during 2018-2026 period
   - Strategy may be too conservative for A-share market

### Root Cause Analysis

**Why did returns underperform?**

1. **Period-Specific**: 2018-2026 was challenging for Chinese bonds
   - Bond yields compressed, limiting return potential
   - A-share market had low returns overall (benchmark only 4.02%)

2. **Over-Conservative Allocation**: Risk parity naturally overweights low-volatility assets
   - 75-80% allocation to bonds is very conservative
   - May be appropriate for US market but too conservative for A-shares

3. **Transaction Costs**: 2,831 trades × 0.03% = significant drag
   - Weekly rebalancing may be too frequent

4. **Data Quality**: Using only 7 ETFs vs planned 8
   - Missing commodity ETF (510170.SH) may have reduced diversification benefits

## Current Weight Allocation

**Latest Rebalance (2026-01-26)**:

| ETF | Weight | Asset Class |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| 511260.SH | 61.90% | 10-year Bond |
| 511090.SH | 15.48% | 30-year Bond |
| 513500.SH | 5.46% | US S&P 500 |
| 510300.SH | 5.23% | 沪深300 |
| 513300.SH | 4.18% | Nasdaq |
| 518880.SH | 4.11% | Gold |
| 510500.SH | 3.63% | 中证500 |

**Risk Contributions**: All assets contribute equally (~0.1429) with std dev = 0.000000 (perfect risk parity)

## Comparison with PDF Expectations

### Variance Analysis

| Aspect | PDF Target | Actual | Variance | Assessment |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|------------|
| Annual Return | 20-25% | 3.71% | -16.29 to -21.29 pp | ❌ Major miss |
| Volatility | ~5% | 2.42% | +2.58 pp | ✅ Better than target |
| Sharpe Ratio | 3.0-4.0 | 0.30 | -2.70 to -3.70 | ❌ Major miss |
| Max Drawdown | 6-10% | -4.12% | +1.88 to +5.88 pp | ✅ Better than target |

**Overall Assessment**: 2 out of 4 metrics met or exceeded targets, but the two that missed (return and Sharpe) are critical performance metrics. **Phase 2 improvements are required**.

---

## Technical Validation

### Risk Parity Verification

✅ **Weights Valid**: Sum = 1.0000, all weights ∈ [0, 1]
✅ **Risk Parity Achieved**: Std dev of risk contributions = 0.000000
✅ **Optimization Successful**: SLSQP converged for all 417 rebalances
✅ **No Fallback**: Never used inverse volatility fallback method

### Data Quality

- ✅ No missing values after forward fill
- ✅ 2,692 trading days of data (2015-2026)
- ⚠️ Only 7 ETFs used (missing 510170.SH commodity ETF)
- ✅ Date range sufficient for 100-day lookback

---

## Recommendations for Phase 2

Based on baseline results, **Phase 2 improvements are REQUIRED**. The strategy meets drawdown and volatility targets but fails to generate adequate returns.

### Proposed Improvements

1. **Increase Stock Allocation**
   - Current: ~20% stocks, 80% bonds
   - Target: 40-50% stocks, 40-50% bonds, 10% alternatives
   - Rationale: Bonds underperformed; need more growth assets

2. **Reduce Rebalancing Frequency**
   - Current: Weekly (417 rebalances over 8 years)
   - Target: Monthly or quarterly
   - Expected impact: Lower transaction costs, higher returns

3. **Add Missing ETF**
   - Include 510170.SH (大宗商品 commodity ETF)
   - Rationale: Complete the planned 8-ETF universe

4. **Adjust Risk-Free Rate**
   - Current: 3% (default)
   - Consider: 2% or market-specific rate
   - Impact: More accurate Sharpe ratio calculation

5. **Consider Tactical Tilts**
   - Pure risk parity may be too mechanical
   - Add modest tactical overlays based on momentum/value signals
   - Keep base risk parity but allow ±10% deviations

6. **Backtest Longer Period**
   - Current: 2018-2026 (8 years)
   - Target: 2015-2026 (11 years) if data quality permits
   - Rationale: More robust testing across market cycles

### Phase 2 Success Criteria

Implement improvements and re-run backtest. Phase 2 success requires:
- Annual return > 10% (halfway to PDF target)
- Sharpe ratio > 1.5 (significant improvement)
- Max drawdown < 10% (maintain excellent risk control)
- Annual volatility < 8% (allow modest increase for higher returns)

## Conclusion

Phase 1 baseline implementation is **complete** and **technically sound**, with perfect risk parity optimization and excellent volatility/drawdown control. However, returns are **significantly below targets**, requiring **Phase 2 improvements**.

**Next Steps**: Proceed to Phase 2 with focus on increasing returns while maintaining risk control.
